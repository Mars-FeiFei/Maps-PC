# Nautical Charts Viewer Sample for Wpf

### Description
ThinkGeo Nautical Charts is a standalone Nuget Package which works with ThinkGeo UI Desktop/Web products. It reads and displays S-57 Electronic Navigational Charts(ENC) from the International Hydrographic Organization(IHO). It can also read style info as defined in an S-52 file. 

 After you have the charts viewer running, use `File -> Open` to load S-57 data (can be downloaded from NOAAâ€™s website), the nautical charts will then appear on the map (an index file will be generated the first time the data is loaded). 

ThinkGeo uses a default style which can be easily modified. The Nautical Charts Viewer provides the ability to switch the map between 5 modes: Day Bright, Day Black, Day White, Dusk and Night. It also has the ability to switch boundary styles, modify labeling, and show different languages.
