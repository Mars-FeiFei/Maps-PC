### Step 3: Activate and manage ThinkGeo products licenses

ThinkGeo offers two different types of licenses: one for development and the other for runtime. The latter is required for the output executable file to function properly.

Now you can activate your development licenses for ThinkGeo products by selecting the corresponding buttons.

Additionally, you can generate runtime licenses for your output EXE file from within the Production Center.

You can also activate ThinkGeo products offline by generating and sending the request file via email to ThinkGeo. Once you receive the license file, you can import it to activate the product.
